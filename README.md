# This is a repo that is "code only" for the TPS Birds class project.

### This code is written in a different way than what the kids wrote as this version was written to be built by Pygbag to run on the web.

All of the assets of the game, specifically the graphics are licensed through Craftpix and cannot be included in the repo.
